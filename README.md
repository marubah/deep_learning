# Deep Learning projects

Projects:

* Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns: predict the number of bikes required in the future using a bike sharing data set.

* Dog Breed Classifier: design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds.

* Generate TV Scripts: build a recurrent neural network to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of a TV show, based on old scripts.

* Generate Faces: implement a Deep Convolutional GAN to generate new faces.

* Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model: train and deploy a sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS.
